# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
 
This project was created for CodePen's challenge for the week of April 19. 2021, [On and Off](https://codepen.io/challenges/2021/april/3).

I started off with their template that had the simple form with radio buttons for on and off.

The idea is inspired by the on/off toggle you often see for dark mode.

But instead of light and dark mode, I use Original and Prestige KDA. So, setting Prestige to 'On' flips the images to the Prestige KDA skin. And setting Prestige to 'Off' flips the images to the original KDA skin.

JavaScript handles the status change (switching between the on/off radio buttons). When the viewer changes it to 'On', a ```class``` that handles the flip is added to the panels. When it's changed to 'Off', the ```class``` is removed.
 
# Optimizations
This works as good as I'd like it too, except I'd like to turn the radio buttons into a toggle, just like on Reddit in the gif.
